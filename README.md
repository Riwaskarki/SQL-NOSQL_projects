# SQL and NoSQL Database Projects

This repository contains several database projects demonstrating the use of PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Python for various data analysis tasks. The main focus of the projects is on understanding and manipulating relational and non-relational database structures as well as using SQL for data storage and retrieval.

## Project Overview

### 1. **Campaign Data Analysis**
   - This project involves analyzing marketing campaign data using PostgreSQL. The data is explored to derive insights on customer behavior, campaign performance, and more.
   
   **Technologies used**:
   - PostgreSQL

### 2. **Loan Data Analysis**
   - This project focuses on analyzing loan data using PostgreSQL. Queries are designed to evaluate the performance of different loans, borrower information, and other financial metrics.
   
   **Technologies used**:
   - PostgreSQL


### 3. **Employee Database (ERD)**
   - This project involves the creation and analysis of a relational database system for managing employee data, departments, salaries, and titles.
   - The data model includes tables such as employees, departments, titles, salaries, and department managers, with relationships defined via foreign keys.
   
   **Technologies used**:
   - PostgreSQL
   - ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)
   
### 4. **Data Cleaning and Analysis in SQL**
   - In this project, data is cleaned and analyzed using various PostgreSQL queries. Datasets used include Nashville housing data, loan data, and marketing campaign data.
   
   **Technologies used**:
   - PostgreSQL

### 5. **PostgreSQL Analysis Projects**
   - These projects focus on using PostgreSQL databases for storing and analyzing data. The data is analyzed using PostgreSQL queries.

   **Technologies used**:
   - PostgreSQL
   - Python (Jupyter Notebooks)
